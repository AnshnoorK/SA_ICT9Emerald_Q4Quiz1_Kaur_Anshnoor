<h2>  Kawasan Falls, Cebu </h2>

<p> Famous for its turquoise waters, this multi-layered waterfall is located in the village of Badian. Most guests remain at the first cascade, which is 40 meters high, where they can swim and get a natural water massage while floating on a bamboo raft. The second cascade is quieter and can be reached after a ten-minute hike.</p>

<div id="Palawan"> 

<h2>  Tubbataha Reef, Palawan </h2>

<p> Considered to be among the best diving locations in the Philippines and possibly in the entire world is Tubbataha Reef. Situated in the midst of the Sulu Sea, it is regarded as a hub for marine biodiversity and a refuge for both divers and marine conservationists. A liveaboard boat from Puerto Princesa, Palawan, is the only means of accessing this marine reserve. </p>

<div id="ElNido"> 

<h2>  Nacpan Beach, El Nido </h2>

<p> Nacpan Beach, 45 minutes away from El Nido's main town, is another dreamlike location. El Nido is most known for its paradisiacal islands and lagoons. Adventures on El Nido's islands, such as a trip to El Nido Big Lagoon and other renowned beaches in Palawan, are highly recommended. However, a visit to the tranquil Nacpan Beach is strongly advised following a busy day of touring El Nido, Palawan's white sand beaches, coves, and limestone cliffs.
